# T-Digest.NET

.NET Implementation of the relatively new T-Digest quantile estimation algorithm. Useful for calculating Quantiles or Percentiles from streaming data, or data-sets that are too large to store in memory and sort, which is required to calculate the true quantile. 

The T-Digest white paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf">here</a>
